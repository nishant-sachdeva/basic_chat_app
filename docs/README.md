# chat_app
Making a basic chat app using Django, React and Node.js

# Aims for the chat app:
1. User Registration
2. Social Auth ( google login )
3. User profile update
4. Sending messages
5. Search User List
6. Generic Socket Service
7. All Api Test
8. Deployment using docker, digital Ocean, and Netlify
9. File Storage using AWS 

( the last two are debatable for me, since I am aiming to store only temporarily ,and mostly using Heroku and PostGres )



Backend API activities:
1. Registration ( username, password )
2. Login ( username, password )
3. Social Login ( Gmail )
4. Users can update profile
5. User can see list of users to chat with
6. User can search through user list
7. User can create message and send to other users
8. Users can edit and delete messages
9. Users can send files to other users
10. Users can fav other users ( they will appear first on the list )
11. Users can archive a user ( removes from the default list , appears on the archive list )
12. User can delete his/her account
